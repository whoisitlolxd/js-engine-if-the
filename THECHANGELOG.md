Merry Christmas!

Added a rare Santa startup that ONLY shows between the dates 12/16 to 12/31!
The default menu theme is now a Christmas remix!
Removed everything related to SB Engine
Fixed camera pointer not showing in the Character Editor
Noteskins now change to your default skin if you call "Change Character" and the character doesn't have a noteskin field
Sustain lengths are now rounded instead of floored
Fixed a bug where some users wouldn't be able to scroll in the Options menu. Additionally, scrolling between the option categories is now more centered.
